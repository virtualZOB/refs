3. All personnel, after verbally providing the position relief briefing, shall
   remain on the position for a minimum of two (2) minutes and advise “monitor
   complete” once the time has elapsed.

## Clearance Delivery

### Issue Clearances / Amendments / Instruction

CD shall issue ATC clearances to IFR and VFR Class B departures as followed:

1. IFR Departures: Standard Instrument Departure Route (SID) should be utilized
   if the aircraft is capable. Aircraft who receive a SID must be issued “Climb
   via SID”. If the aircraft is not filed on a SID, they shall be:
    - Jet: cleared to maintain 6,000ft.
    - Turboprop/Piston: cleared to maintain 4,000ft.
2. GTLKE SID usage:
    - DAIFE transition for use for ORD departures only.
    - BAGEL transition for use for MDW departures only.
    - ALPHE/YABRO transition for use for any departure.
3. Local IFR: aircraft requesting a “local” IFR (destination airports within the
   CLE terminal area) clearance shall be issued 4,000 feet and radar vectors to
   destination airport.
4. VFR Class B Departures: determine destination/direction of flight, clear
   aircraft “out” of CLE Class B, and maintain VFR at or below the following
   altitudes:

| If on-course heading is: | Clear aircraft at or below: |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| 252 - 058 (Clockwise)    | 2,500                       |
| 059 - 251 (Clockwise)    | 3,000                       |

5. Departure Frequency Designation:
    - Aircraft cleared via GTLKE#, PFLYD#, ZAAPA# and Non-SID departures shall
      be assigned DN (D) as their departure frequency.
    - Aircraft cleared via CAVVS# and KKIDS# shall be assigned DS (R) as their
      departure frequency.
6. Ensure that all aircraft requesting clearance have current ATIS code.

### Weather Information/ATIS

#### Receiving

1. CLE weather should be received via the ATC client or the Aviation Weather
   Center.
2. CWAs, SIGMETs, AIRMETs, and NOTAMs should be received from the Aviation
   Weather Center and/or the FAA.

#### Disseminating

1. CD shall ensure that all Tower control positions and TRACON receive the new
   ATIS code.
2. CD shall notify CIC when weather changes from VFR to IFR or from IFR to VFR.

## Ground Control

### Jurisdiction of Movement Area

GC has jurisdiction of the movement area north of runway 06L/24R extended
centerline and south of runway 06R/24L extended centerline. Areas shaded red in
Figure 4-1[^1] are owned by LC unless otherwise coordinated.

### Scanning Movement Area

GC shall be aware of and operationally scan the work environment and following
problem/restricted areas:

- Only ONE aircraft shall have clearance to move on taxiway H.
- All helicopter movements under control of LC shall be monitored carefully and
  subsequent aircraft movements shall be planned around these helicopter
  movements by GC.

### Plan Ground Movement

1. IAW the usage of the CLE ASSC, GC shall ensure all aircraft are squawking
   mode normal/C prior to being issued further ground movement clearance.
2. GC shall ensure to not allow aircraft to proceed on to a runway without
   transfer of control or approval from LC.
3. GC shall coordinate with LC all requests for intersection departures or
   secondary runway usage.
4. If non-standard runway departure is requested, GC shall coordinate with LC
   prior to taxi clearance.
5. GC shall give way to aircraft exiting runways unless otherwise coordinated.
6. GC shall be made aware of local in-trail restrictions and as necessary:
   sequence traffic on taxiway to expedite departures. Sequencing aircraft based
   off of routing shall be IAW 3.1d/e.

### Runway Crossing

1. Usage of active runway shall remain the responsibility of LC. GC shall NOT
   cross runways designated as active, unless coordinated and approved by LC.
2. When coordinating runway crossings, GC shall request by providing the runway
   number and intersection for which the aircraft shall be crossed.
    - If the request is approved, LC shall explicitly state “cross” followed by
      the runway designation and intersection.
    - If the request is unable to be approved, LC shall NOT state “cross” but
      instead shall explicitly state “hold short of runway (designation)”.
    - Upon crossing completion, GC shall advise LC by stating “crossing
      complete” followed by the controller’s operational initials (OIs).

## Local Control

### Jurisdiction of Airspace

LC has jurisdiction of airspace as follows, and has control of aircraft when
talking to any aircraft within 10NM of the airport unless otherwise coordinated.

1. South Flow and West Flow
2. North Flow

### Departure Procedures

1. LC is responsible for ensuring initial separation between departures and
   other aircraft (i.e. successive departure, missed approach, VFR), and is
   permitted by DN/DS to automatically release aircraft with the exception of
   local IFR.
2. In north flow:
    - SID aircraft shall be cleared for takeoff and fly their ROTG pilot-nav
      segment IAW their filed SID.
    - Non-SID aircraft with their route parallel to GTLKE#, PFLYD#, ZAAPA# SIDs
      shall be issued a heading in the range of RWY clockwise to 320°.
    - Non-SID aircraft with their route parallel to CAVVS# and KKIDS# SIDs shall
      be issued a heading in the range of RWY counter-clockwise to 100°.
    - LC shall enter the assigned heading in the scratchpad accordingly.
3. In south flow:
    - SID aircraft shall be cleared for takeoff and fly their ROTG pilot-nav
      segment IAW their filed SID.
    - Non-SID aircraft with their route parallel to GTLKE#, PFLYD#, ZAAPA# SIDs
      shall be issued heading in the range of RWY clockwise to 320°.
    - Non-SID aircraft with their route parallel to CAVVS# and KKIDS# SIDs shall
      be issued a heading in the range of RWY counter-clockwise to 180°.
    - LC shall enter the assigned heading in the scratchpad accordingly.
4. In west flow:
    - GTLKE#, PFLYD#, ZAAPA# aircraft and non-SID aircraft with its route
      parallel to those SIDs shall be issued a heading in the range of RWY
      clockwise to 320°.
    - CAVVS# and KKIDS# aircraft and non-SID aircraft with its route parallel to
      those SIDs shall be issued a heading in the range of RWY counter-clockwise
      to 180°.
    - LC shall enter the assigned heading in the scratchpad accordingly.
5. LC is responsible for ensuring 3NM separation or greater between subsequent
   departures on the *same* RNAV SID.
    - **NOTE**: GTLKE# and ZAAPA# in NORTH FLOW are considered the same RNAV SID
      and require 3 miles or greater from LC to radar.

4. When an arrival aircraft exits the runway, issue an initial taxi clearance
   that permits the aircraft to keep moving, clearing runway exits, without
   infringing on GC’s operation or designated control area.

### Reduced Separation Procedures

Reduced longitudinal separation of 2.5NM between aircraft established on the
final approach course within 10NM of the landing runway is authorized for
24L/06R and 24R/06L when running independently. The following conditions must be
met:

   trailing aircraft.
2. Heavy aircraft and B757 are permitted to participate as the trailing aircraft
   only.

   to the aircraft executing a missed approach or go-around.
2. LC must assign the aircraft 4,000ft and a heading IAW the dispersal areas
   defined in 5.1. The affected departure sector must be advised of this heading
   assignment prior to transfer of communication.
