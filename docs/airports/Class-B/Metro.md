1. Bolded positions must be opened first. Other positions may only be opened  during events or with the permission of the ATM/DATM/TA/EC/CIC.
2. When only one ground and local position is open, callsigns may be simplified to DTW_GND and DTW_TWR, respectively. In the event that ground and local are split:
    - Ground will operate as DTW_W_GND on 121.800 and DTW_E_GND on 119.450
3. Local will operate:
    - DTW_N_TWR on 128.120 and DTW_S_TWR on 135.000
    - DTW_W_TWR on 128.120 and DTW_E_TWR on 128.750.
    - A combination of the two options is NOT permitted.

## Runway/Flow Procedures
1. RWYs 21/22 are designated as the preferential runways.
2. DTW CIC has primary responsibility for initiating and coordinating runway changes. The DTW OM/OS/CIC determines the runway in use for DTW. Collaborate with D21 and ZOB TMUs for proposed runway changes. Use the  following factors to determine the runway configuration:
    - Winds, to include: current, forecasted, TDWR boundary, adjacent facility, and final approach (pilot reported 500’ and below) winds.
    - Runway Selector Guide (see Appendix 2). 
    - Runway availability based upon contaminants (standing water, FOD, etc.), snow removal, braking action, construction, emergencies, and/or special activities.
    - Environmental documents concerning Quiet Hours and South Flow priority.
3. Inform DTW personnel when a runway change is going to occur. Ensure LC does not release new runway configuration departures until the change has been completed.
4. Advise D21 CIC of the last aircraft to depart under the old configuration and when DTW has completed the runway change.
5. Update the ATIS.
6. Change appropriate equipment configuration.
7. Opening and/or closing a runway.
    - Coordinate with D21 OM/OS/CIC, and DTW/D21 TMU.
    - Ensure ATIS, ASDE-X, and IDS are updated

## Arrival/Departure Procedures
1. Coordinate the TCP with D21.
2. Reduced Separation on Final.
    - Separation of 2.5NM is authorized between aircraft established on the final approach course within 10NM of landing RWYs 03R, 21L, 04L, 22R, and 22L IAW JO 7110.65. 
    -Should conditions prohibit the exercise of, or warrant suspension of this procedure, DTW will ensure the phrase “2.5 NA” appears on the DTW and D21 SIA pages of the IDS-4.
3. Simultaneous Departures and Arrivals on Parallel Runways with Staggered Thresholds. Ensure ATIS contains the statement, “simultaneous arrival and
departure operations are in use on RWYs 22R and 22L”. See para. 6-2-9 for additional requirements.
4. Check the ATIS and IDS for accuracy and currency.
5. Adhere to all National Traffic Management directives and procedures.

## Duty Familiarization and Transfer of Position Responsibility
1. All operational tower personnel are required to complete duty familiarization at the beginning of each shift.
2. All operational positions require operational continuity through a transfer of position responsibility. Relief briefings shall be conducted verbally. With the approval of the controller being relieved, the relieving controller shall properly configure the position prior to transfer of control. Upon combining positions or position relief, there will be a 2-minute overlap. At the conclusion of the overlap, the relieved controller must state their operating initials verbally.
    - **Note:** The OS/CIC may waive the 2-minute overlap requirement if they deem the situation warrants. The following (not all-inclusive) may justify waiving the overlap:
        - Traffic
        - Staffing necessity
        - Physiological need.
4. When position relief is required at a position where training is being conducted, the trainee (OJT) will brief the OJTI. When the briefing is completed, the OJT will unplug and the relieving CPC will plug in and receive a briefing from the OJTI. The OJTI, CIC or OS may waive the OJT briefing at their discretion.

5. All departures via CLVIN#, BARII#, and SNDRS# procedures during south flow operations must adhere to the following departure separation requirements:
    - (INSERT CHART HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
    - Note: MIT specified as “Boundary” references the local airspace boundary with D21 departure.
6. Ensure that aircraft are on their assigned route prior to frequency change.
7. When an airborne aircraft will be taken off the RNAV OTG procedure, do not release a subsequent departure that will enter the receiving  controller’s airspace until that aircraft exits the lateral limits of DTW airspace

### LUAW
In addition to the requirements in JO 7110.65, the following procedures must be followed while conducting LUAW:
1. During same runway operations, while LUAW is being applied, landing clearance must be withheld if the conditions are less than reported ceiling 800 or visibility less than 2SM. Landing clearance may be issued once the departing aircraft starts takeoff roll.
    - *EXAMPLE: “DAL123, runway 22L, continue, traffic holding in position.”*
2. C must not be combined with any other non-local position
3. Do not authorize an aircraft to LUAW at any time when the intersection is not visible from the tower. 
    - **EXCEPTION:** Via waiver, DTW is authorized to LUAW at RWY 04R at TWY Y-2 when the intersection is not visible from the tower provided:
        - GC must ensure the accuracy of the departure sequence prior to switching the aircraft to LC
        - GC and LC must correlate the aircraft’s position using the ASDE IAW JO 7110.65. 
        - LC must state the aircraft call sign and intersection on initial contact when issuing a LUAW clearance IAW prescribed phraseology (JO 7110.65, para. 3-9-4).
        - LC must receive pilot read back for accuracy when issuing a LUAW clearance at an intersection, and restate the aircraft call sign and intersection when issuing a departure clearance IAW prescribed phraseology (JO 7110.65, para. 3-9-4).
        - RWY 04R must be restricted to departures only when the waiver is in use. 
        - Ensure only one aircraft at a time is permitted to LUAW on RWY 04R.

### Release Definitions
1. Rolling Call: The notification that the released aircraft has begun departure roll.
2. Release: Authorization to enter airspace or depart on a SID delegated to another local controller.
3. Releasing Controller: The controller delegating airspace required by the other controller.
4. Released Controller: The controller receiving a release.

### Coordination for Departure Releases
1. When CIC or TMU coordinates a release:
    - Release aircraft as determined by CIC or TMU.
    - It is the releasing controller’s responsibility to initiate coordination.
2. When LC coordinates a release, include the following:
    - SID and/or heading; advise if aircraft is VFR.
    - Type aircraft if wake turbulence is applicable.
3. Types of releases.
    - Without traffic. A releasing controller approves a request; phraseology: “(type aircraft if applicable) (SID/heading) RELEASED.”
    - With traffic. When a releasing controller approves a request with traffic exchange, the following conditions must be met:
        - Conflicting airborne/rolling traffic information must be issued, i.e. “KAYLN AIRBORNE, SNDRS ROLLING, CCOBB RELEASED.”
        - Traffic is observed and acknowledged by the released controller.
        - Separation responsibility is transferred to the released controller.

When RWYs 27L/R are being used for arrival traffic, DTW ATCT will depart RWY 22R to  the maximum extent possible with strong emphasis toward safety and efficiency. When conditions are such that departing RWY 22R is no longer feasible, RWYs 27L/R will be used for departure traffic.

Utilize the following guide as an aid in determining runway/flow direction: 
- **NOTE:** The guide below is based on steady state winds. When gusts are reported, additional consideration must be given based on the velocity, frequency and duration of the gusts.
