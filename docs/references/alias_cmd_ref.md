# Alias Command Reference  
The following is a description of vZOB Alias commands available.

You may practice the use of these commands [HERE](https://refs.clevelandcenter.org/references/alias-practice/).


These commands are specific to the vZOB facility and this document will not cover alias commands that are built-in to the CRC software; For CRC-Specific commands, please reference the CRC manual found [HERE](https://crc.virtualnas.net/docs/#/). vZOB only supports the use of CRC; All other programs will not be explained via this document.


Alias commands were once primarily used for text-to-pilot communications but these days they are used in a much more powerful manner such as the in-scope reference system. Also, with more pilots using voice capabilities, one should consider the alias command system more as a tool rather than a communication method. Therefore, to avoid confusion between tools and communication, if information is going to be sent to a pilot in any manner, the command will be prefixed with a “T" for “text" after the initial period.
See "Text to Pilots" section for context.


## COLUMNS EXPLANATION

- SYNTAX
    - How the command is formatted.
    - Unless otherwise stated, Airport ID’s (APT ID) are the FAA code, not the ICAO.
    - {== FAC ID ==} = Facility ID code
    - {== POS ID ==} = Position ID code/The computer ID code assigned to a position/controlling position.
    - Text that is {== HIGHLIGHTED ==} conveys the info that is required to be typed in that place.
    - Text that is <ins>UNDERLINED</ins> indicates that it is optional information and is not required.
    - ``(space)`` indicates when to hit the space-bar at that point.
    - Unless otherwise indicated, to complete a command, the user must press the ENTER button on their keyboard. If the term ASEL is present after the command, the user is to complete the command by first selecting the aircraft, type the alias command, then pressing their designated “Aircraft Select" key on their keyboard. Choosing an ASEL should have been part of the initial setup of your software; For more info on what the ASEL key is, consult the software manual.
- DESCRIPTION
    - Describes what happens when the command is completed or will provide an example of what is displayed.
    - If a note with a number is referenced in this box, refer to the NOTES section of this reference document for further information concerning how to effectively utilize this command.
- EXAMPLE
    - Displays an example of the command using a procedure or other variables.
- NOTES
    - TTP = This command has a "Text-To-Pilot" equivalent. Generally, all the user has to do is put a T right after the period and before starting the rest of the command and have either the aircraft selected or in a private message to that pilot.

## Notes

[^1]: This command speaks to the VATSIM API every 3min so there may be a delay when an aircraft initially logs on to the command working.
[^2]: 
    Commands like these are useful because they have another command that is similar. For example if you wanted to draw all the fixes for the CLE BRWNZ arrival on your scope and you wanted the chart to be recalled, simply complete one of the commands, then use your keyboards UP arrow to have it display again, use your backspace button to remove the last character and replace it with the appropriate letter for the other command. <br>
      **Example**:
      - .CLEBRWNZC
      - *Up arrow to display .CLEBRWNZC again, Then I just backspace to remove the C*
      - *Then type F resulting in:*
      - .CLEBRWNZF
[^3]: Reference the [FE-Buddy manual](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRMd6PIRrj0lPb4sAi9KB7iM3u5zn0dyUVLqEcD9m2e71nf0UPyEmkOs4ZwYsQdl7smopjdvw_iWEyP/embed?slide=id.p) for SPad Code concept and syntax explanations. 
[^4]:
    Given this alias is meant to be sent to a text-only pilot, and these situations are dying out, so not every variable will be accounted for with these commands as it would take too long to develop those resources, let alone expect ATC to become moderately familiar with all of the syntaxes that are available
