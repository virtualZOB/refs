What command provides you a script to read for a holding clearance. Check Answer GENERAL ASSISTANCE Today is your lucky day because a pilot just hit you with a request for VFR on top. Is it IFR or VFR? Is it even allowed? Do I first have to verify this clearance will allow for compliance with local traffic pattern and obstruction clearance? Do you have to ask your father for permission first? I don't know about all that but we at least provide you a script to read to get the basics down. What command gets you this script?
